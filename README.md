<p>1 - We think that roblox is a game that people play to have fun and meet other people that enjoy playing Roblox. There are in game challenges and simulators to explore, where you either have to get to the end without failing, or enhance your character so that they are able to surive in the Roblox metaverse!</p>
    
<p>2 - A few of our favourite things about roblox is that you get to customise your character and to play games with people and have a house in any game. You can make friends, create games and also play in games that other people have created. We also like how you can choose to play in a realistic game or somethign more fantastical. We like the fact that there are so many options!
  
  Currently, our favourite games are; Royal High, Brookhaven, Meepcity, Lifetopia, Squid Game, Among Us, Feather Life, Tiger Life and Dragons Life, Glory of the Gods, Giant Survival.</p>

<p>3 - I think that Roblox would be even better if everyone was able to earn free Robux which is the Roblox in game currency/token. i think this would enhance Roblox, as it would give those a chance that may not be able to purchase Robux to upgrade thier characters and to get to better worlds or dimentions. I would also like see more options for pretty skins and less glitches as this is the biggst negative for us.</p>
